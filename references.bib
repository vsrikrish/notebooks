  demand, CO2 emissions and similar factors that extend many decades into the
  future. The past performance of such projections has been systematically
  overconfident. Analysts have often used scenarios based on detailed story
  lines that spell out “plausible alternative futures” as a central tool for
  evaluating uncertainty. No probabilities are typically assigned to such
  scenarios. We argue that this practice is often ineffective. Rather than
  expanding people’s judgment about the range of uncertainty about the future,
  scenario-based analysis is more likely to lead to systematic overconfidence,
  to an underestimate of the range of possible future outcomes. We review
  relevant findings from the literature on human judgment under uncertainty and
  discuss their relevance to the task of making probabilistic projections. The
  more detail that one adds to the story line of a scenario, the more probable
  it will appear to most people, and the greater the difficulty they likely will
  have in imagining other, equally or more likely, ways in which the same
  outcome could be reached. We suggest that scenario based approaches make
  analysts particularly prone to such cognitive biases, and then outline a
  strategy by which improved projections, tailored to the needs of specific
  decision makers, might be developed.},

               largely control climate dynamics, rather than orbital forcing,
               and temperature does have a reinforcing feedback on
               greenhouse-gas concentrations. The statistical association
               between temperature and greenhouse gases over glacial cycles is
               well documented1, but causality behind this correlation remains
               difficult to extract directly from the data. A time lag of CO2
               behind Antarctic temperature---originally thought to hint at a
               driving role for temperature2,3---is absent4,5 at the last
               deglaciation, but recently confirmed at the last ice age
               inception6 and the end of the earlier termination II (ref. 7).
               We show that such variable time lags are typical for complex
               nonlinear systems such as the climate, prohibiting
               straightforward use of correlation lags to infer causation.
               However, an insight from dynamical systems theory8 now allows us
               to circumvent the classical challenges of unravelling causation
               from multivariate time series. We build on this insight to
               demonstrate directly from ice-core data that, over
               glacial--interglacial timescales, climate dynamics are largely
               driven by internal Earth system mechanisms, including a marked

  Here, we introduce an agent-based modeling framework to explore the impact of
  structural versus parametric choices of household flood aversion on modeled
  outcomes of flood risk in a hypothetical urban environment. We deploy three
  structural variants of the model that fundamentally differ in the manner in
  which households are assumed to interface with flood hazards (disamenity,
  avoidance, and protection), evaluating multiple model parameterizations within
  each structural variant. The structural variants lead to fundamentally
  different conclusions regarding the evolution of flood risk, indicating that
  the structural choices made regarding human representation in flood risk ABMs
  have substantial bearing on modeling insights and ought to be elevated from an
  overlooked to a critical aspect of future modeling efforts.},

  abstract = {Bayesian inference requires all unknowns to be represented by
  probability distributions, which awkwardly implies that the probability of an
  event for which we are completely ignorant (e.g., that the world's greatest
  boxer would defeat the world's greatest wrestler) must be assigned a
  particular numerical value such as 1/2, as if it were known as precisely as
  the probability of a truly random event (e.g., a coin flip).Robust Bayes and
  belief functions are two methods that have been proposed to distinguish
  ignorance and randomness. In robust Bayes, a parameter can be restricted to a
  range, but without a prior distribution, yielding a range of potential
  posterior inferences. In belief functions (also known as the Dempster-Shafer
  theory), probability mass can be assigned to subsets of parameter space, so
  that randomness is represented by the probability distribution and uncertainty
  is represented by large subsets, within which the model does not attempt to
  assign probabilities.Through a simple example involving a coin flip and a
  boxing/wrestling match, we illustrate difficulties with robust Bayes and
  belief functions. In short: robust Bayes allows ignorance to spread too
  broadly, and belief functions inappropriately collapse to simple Bayesian
  models.},

  abstract = {Planning under deep uncertainty, when probabilistic
  characterizations of the future are unknown, is a major challenge in water
  resources management. Many planning frameworks advocate for “scenario-neutral”
  analyses in which alternative policies are evaluated over plausible future
  scenarios with no assessment of their likelihoods. Instead, these frameworks
  use sensitivity analysis to discover which uncertain factors have the greatest
  influence on performance. This knowledge can be used to design monitoring
  programs and adaptive policies that respond to changes in the critical
  uncertainties. However, scenario-neutral analyses make implicit assumptions
  about the range and independence of the uncertain factors that may not be
  consistent with the coupled human-hydrologic processes influencing the system.
  These assumptions could influence which factors are found to be most important
  and which policies are most robust, belying their neutrality; assuming
  uniformity and independence could have decision-relevant implications. This
  study illustrates these implications using a multistakeholder planning problem
  within the Colorado River Basin, where hundreds of rights holders vie for the
  river's limited water under the law of prior appropriation. Variance-based
  sensitivity analyses are performed to assess users' vulnerabilities to
  changing hydrologic conditions using four experimental designs: (1)
  scenario-neutral samples of hydrologic factors, centered on recent historical
  conditions, (2) scenarios informed by climate projections, (3) scenarios
  informed by paleohydrologic reconstructions, and (4) scenario-neutral samples
  of hydrologic factors spanning all previous experimental designs. Differences
  in sensitivities and user robustness rankings across the experiments
  illustrate the challenges of inferring the most consequential drivers of
  vulnerabilities to design effective monitoring programs and robust management
  policies.},
