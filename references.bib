  abstract = {A variety of decision makers need projections of future energy
  demand, CO2 emissions and similar factors that extend many decades into the
  future. The past performance of such projections has been systematically
  overconfident. Analysts have often used scenarios based on detailed story
  lines that spell out “plausible alternative futures” as a central tool for
  evaluating uncertainty. No probabilities are typically assigned to such
  scenarios. We argue that this practice is often ineffective. Rather than
  expanding people’s judgment about the range of uncertainty about the future,
  scenario-based analysis is more likely to lead to systematic overconfidence,
  to an underestimate of the range of possible future outcomes. We review
  relevant findings from the literature on human judgment under uncertainty and
  discuss their relevance to the task of making probabilistic projections. The
  more detail that one adds to the story line of a scenario, the more probable
  it will appear to most people, and the greater the difficulty they likely will
  have in imagining other, equally or more likely, ways in which the same
  outcome could be reached. We suggest that scenario based approaches make
  analysts particularly prone to such cognitive biases, and then outline a
  strategy by which improved projections, tailored to the needs of specific
  decision makers, might be developed.},

  abstract  = "Although the correlation between greenhouse gases and
               temperature is well documented, it is difficult to show
               causality from the data. This study uses insight from dynamical
               systems theory to show that internal Earth system mechanisms
               largely control climate dynamics, rather than orbital forcing,
               and temperature does have a reinforcing feedback on
               greenhouse-gas concentrations. The statistical association
               between temperature and greenhouse gases over glacial cycles is
               well documented1, but causality behind this correlation remains
               difficult to extract directly from the data. A time lag of CO2
               behind Antarctic temperature---originally thought to hint at a
               driving role for temperature2,3---is absent4,5 at the last
               deglaciation, but recently confirmed at the last ice age
               inception6 and the end of the earlier termination II (ref. 7).
               We show that such variable time lags are typical for complex
               nonlinear systems such as the climate, prohibiting
               straightforward use of correlation lags to infer causation.
               However, an insight from dynamical systems theory8 now allows us
               to circumvent the classical challenges of unravelling causation
               from multivariate time series. We build on this insight to
               demonstrate directly from ice-core data that, over
               glacial--interglacial timescales, climate dynamics are largely
               driven by internal Earth system mechanisms, including a marked
               positive feedback effect from temperature variability on
               greenhouse-gas concentrations.",
