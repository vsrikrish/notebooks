# Notebooks

This repository hosts my notebooks in a basic Quarto blog format. I use these notes to think through ideas; I make no guarantees that anything here is useful or even necessarily coherent, and very little of it will be final. The format is highly inspired by [Cosma Shalizi's notebooks](https://bactra.org/notebooks).
