These are my notebooks, which serve mostly to organize my thoughts on topics I find interesting. If they're useful to you, great! If not, oh well. And if they're mostly incoherent, I guess that's to be expected. Nothing is finalized, everything is a work in progress.

If you're also interested in any of these topics and have thoughts, please feel free to [let me know](mailto:viveks@cornell.edu).
