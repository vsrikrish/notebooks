    "text": "Robustness is a vaguely defined term. There are really two different, though related, types of robustness, as the term is commonly used:\nThe former is the focus in this notebook, though the latter is often more interesting and difficult to quantify; often one has to link back to the original system and ensure that the model was adequate (not valid, as commonly used) and that the insights make sense (Oreskes et al., 1994)."

    "text": "Satisfycing\nSatisfycing measures how often a particular performance threshold is reached across the range of states of the world. In other words, assign a 0-1 loss over the tolerable domain \\(D \\subset X\\):\n\\[L(\\mathbf{x}) = \\begin{cases}0 & \\mathbf{x} \\in D \\\\ 1 & \\mathbf{x} \\notin D.\\end{cases}\\]\nThen the satisfycing score is\n\\[\\int_X L(\\mathbf{x}) p(x) dx = \\int_D p(x) dx.\\]\n\nSensitivity of Satisfycing Score to Probabilities\nThis makes the score sensitive to the probability distribution \\(p\\) and the tolerable domain \\(D\\). As a result, even if the tolerable threshold is well-defined2 this begs the question somewhat, as the robustness scores will depend on how frequently poorly-performing scenarios are sampled. A uniform distribution may be the worst option of all3. A good sensitivity analysis can diagnose this type of issue, but may not be reflected in a satisfycing approach. Quinn et al. (2020) shows that this notion of robustness is not itself robust to different scenario samples; this is related to fundamental issues with “Robust Bayes” (Gelman, 2006).2 Which seems unlikely across stakeholders, but let’s grant that for now…3 The principle of insufficient reason is only one way to express ignorance, and makes no sense for subjective probabilities (Kass & Wasserman, 1996).\nKass, R. E., & Wasserman, L. (1996). The selection of prior distributions by formal rules. J. Am. Stat. Assoc., 91, 1343–1370. https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.1996.10477003\n\nQuinn, J. D., Hadjimichael, A., Reed, P. M., & Steinschneider, S. (2020). Can exploratory modeling of water scarcity vulnerabilities and robustness be scenario neutral? Earth’s Future, 8, e2020EF001650. https://doi.org/10.1029/2020EF001650\n\nGelman, A. (2006). The boxer, the wrestler, and the coin flip: A paradox of robust bayesian inference and belief functions. Am. Stat., 60, 146–150. https://doi.org/10.1198/000313006X106190\n\nFor analyzing a single decision or a set of decisions, this approach is likely fine to understand the sensitivity of the decision’s adequacy to mis-parameterization. Things get worse when trying to use robustness as an objective for the decision analysis, particularly when probabilities are diffuse or ill-characterized, as obtaining the state(s) of the world used in the analysis is itself fraught and/or relies on subjective probabilities anyway: the resulting decision is itself likely highly sensitive to any number of decisions in the problem setup, and now we’re back at the other kind of robustness.\n\n\nModel Discrepancy\nThere’s also another, maybe more fundamental issue: model discrepancy. If your performance threshold is \\(\\tau\\) and the model prediction for a state of the world \\(s\\) is \\(F(s)\\), you want to know if \\(f(s) &gt; \\tau\\). But if \\(F\\) has a discrepancy \\(\\zeta(s)\\), you could mis-score \\(s\\) if \\(\\zeta\\) moves you to the other side of \\(\\tau\\), with potentially important implications44 This isn’t unique to the robustness setting, either: it applies to any model-based decision analysis with a 0-1 loss. For example, we should talk about this more in the context of pathways to zero emissions."

    "text": "Regret\nRegret is fine and reasonably sensible: it’s a Bayesian score with a loss of the following type:\n\\[L(\\mathbf{x}) = \\begin{cases}0 & if \\mathbf{x} \\in D \\\\ R(\\| \\mathbf{x} - \\tau \\|) & if \\mathbf{x} \\notin D,\\end{cases}\\] where \\(\\| \\cdot \\|\\) is some metric over outcomes. Nothing too interesting, and likely leads to more sensible rankings than satisfycing when they differ. I also think it’s preferable for decision-making to losses which are more mathematical constructs than decision-relevant, like mean or logarithmic losses. For certain choices of \\(L\\), this also helps smooth out the model discrepancy issue, since you can make the loss within some neighborhood of the boundary of \\(D\\) positive as a buffer and adjust \\(R\\) to smooth the transition from \\(D\\) to a high-regret region. It might be interesting to explore this in a quick paper, maybe for the shallow lake problem or coastal flood risk."

A common tendency along among certain climate-change skeptics2 was to use Granger causality to claim that warming causes CO2 increases. This use violates the relevant assumptions of Granger causality, namely that there is no confounding causal influence on both time series3. Instead, Nes et al. (2015) show using Takens’ theorem that we get the expected feedbacks on the right time scales.2 Who know only enough to make these mistakes but not recognize them!3 In this case, Milankovitch cycles but we also know that the relationship between temperature and CO2 changes depending on the time scale of interest\nNes, E.

Using an ensemble of simulations would allow us to look for tipping points or teleconnections or track the propagation of shocks4. The complications in making this tractable are stochasticity5 and dimensionality6, but maybe looking at network properties can reduce the dimensionality. Maybe this can be done with the PC algorithm.4 “George Box has [almost] said”The only way to find out what will happen when a complex system is disturbed is to disturb the system, not merely to observe it passively.” These words of caution about “natural experiments” are uncomfortably strong. Yet in today’s world we see no alternative to accepting them as, if anything, too weak.” - Mosteller & Tukey (1977)5 We would need to reconstruct a Markov process6 Finding the relevant DAG is expensive."
