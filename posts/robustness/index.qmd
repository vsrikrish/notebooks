Robustness is a vaguely defined term. There are really two different, though related, types of robustness, as the term is commonly used:

1. Robustness of a decision, *i.e.* how well does a particular decision perform under alternative states of the world (SOWs)?
2. Robustness of model insights to researcher degrees of freedom/forking paths.

The former is the focus in this notebook, though the latter is often more interesting and difficult to quantify; often one has to link back to the original system and ensure that the model was adequate (not *valid*, as commonly used) and that the insights make sense [@Oreskes1994-br].

## Decision Robustness

Assessing the robustness of a decision is best done as a summary of a type of sensitivity: pick a solution that seems acceptable under some decision-making method, and then stress-test it to make sure it performs adequately across scenarios^[Picking the threshold for adequate peformance is another issue...]. A rough way to think about satisfycing^[Some other robustness metrics don't lend themselves to this framework, and so may not have the same issues.] as some metrics have some In other words, assign a 0-1 loss over the tolerable domain $D \subset X$:

$$L(\mathbf{x}) = \begin{cases}0 & \mathbf{x} \in D \\ 1 & \mathbf{x} \notin D.\end{cases}$$

Then the satisfycing score is 

$$\int_X L(\mathbf{x}) p(x) dx = \int_D p(x) dx.$$

This makes the score sensitive to the probability distribution $p$ and the tolerable domain $D$. As a result, even if the tolerable threshold is well-defined^[Which seems unlikely across stakeholders, but let's grant that for now...] this begs the question somewhat, as the robustness scores will depend on how frequently poorly-performing scenarios are sampled. A uniform distribution may be the worst option of all^[The principle of insufficient reason is only one way to express ignorance, and makes no sense for subjective probabilities [@Kass1996-ro].]. A good sensitivity analysis can diagnose this type of issue, but may not be reflected in a robustness-maximizing approach. @Quinn2020-cr shows that this notion of robustness is not itself robust to different scenario samples; this is related to fundamental issues with "Robust Bayes" [@Gelman2006-eh].

For analyzing a single decision or a set of decisions, this approach is likely fine to understand the sensitivity of the decision to mis-parameterization. Things get worse when trying to use robustness as an objective for the decision analysis, particularly when probabilities are diffuse or ill-characterized, as obtaining the state(s) of the world used in the analysis is itself fraught and/or relies on subjective probabilities anyway: the resulting decision is itself likely highly sensitive to any number of decisions in the problem setup, and now we're back at the other kind of robustness.
